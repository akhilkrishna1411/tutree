Dimensionality reduction:
whenever we are having a 2-Dimensions datset or 3D we can easily visualize through scatter plot but what if we have more than 3D i.e if we are having 100 dimesnion data
then dimenionality reduction plays a major role.if our data lies in n-D space we try to convert into 2D or 3D
so we have a bunch of techniques like PCA & t-SNE
